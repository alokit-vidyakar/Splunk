What I have done till now is that I have cloned the repository splunk from my GIThub acoount
Now i have done an init on outer folder. Havan't done init on this folder.
Now, I have performed git add .
After doing this add, I have created this text file using vim. Gonna commit now so see if it gets added in my got repo or not

******************RESULT******************************

the commit gave output that master branch is upto date and doesnot have any file to add.
if you want to add this file then add the file and commit again.
